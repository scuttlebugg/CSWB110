   <h2>Some Weird Hobbies of Mine</h2>
  <p>Check out some of my hobbies here. I've given a little more info where more info is necessary to explain or define these passions of mine!</p>
     <dl>Foraging & Strange Food</dl>
        <dd>I have an obsession with wild foods. I love to forage for chantrelles in the fall, blackberries and salal in the summer, and fresh greens and herbs whenever I can find them. My food obsession extends into making my own foods like kimchi, kombucha, kvass and other lactofermented goods. Fun fact, this summer I collected 15 pounds of blackberries in about an hour (and made a ton of preserves)!</dd>
     <dl>Games & More Games</dl>
        <dd>Since high school I've had a love for tabletop RPG's and have participated in many DnD and Pathfinder campaigns through college and beyond. My gaming habit extends into console and PC gaming, too. I've spent hundreds of hours running around Tamriel and Azeroth alike. Open world games have been a favorite of mine for years. A dream of mine is to somehow weasel my way into that industry some day. Currently, I enjoy plying The Isle and fear/anticipate the glorious day Bethesda reseases Elder Scrolls 6. I'll probably not leave the house for a week (kidding, I hope)!</dd>
     <dl>Bouldering, Sport, & Toprope Climbing</dl>
        <dd>While I was in college I taught children and adult classes at the local climbing gym. I was also on the Humboldt State University's climbing team. Climbing is stil something I enjoy, though I don't spend nearly as much time as I'd like doing it. Gear can be quite costly, and sometimes good climbing spots are hard to get to, or very far away.</dd>
     <dl>Herpetology... And Everything Biology</dl>
        <dd>I love reptiles and amphibians so much! I worked in pet stores through high scool, and managed a reptiles and exotics store for a little while. It was a lot of fun, but has led me to pull my support from the pet trade-- especially the exotic pet trade. Though I love and appreciate the beautyof these animals, I do not consider taking anything into custody; an animal's freedom is part of what makes it beautiful.<br>
          Anything related to biology will keep me entertained for hours. I have my microscopes at home, and will admire the patterns on a beetle shell, or the sparkle in a flower petal for half an hour before I realize time has got away from me.
     </dd>
     <dl>Classic Volkswagens</dl>
        <dd>My first car was a 1972 Volkswagen Beetle. I love that car to death and refuse to part with it. He's still in great running condition, and will be restored someday. I drove him maybe 100,000 miles around the west coast, attended countless club meetings, campouts, and shows, rebuilt the motor, and replaced the transmission (twice. Long story.)! I also had a 1975 Westfalia that I had to sell, sadly. But it went to a nice man in Wyoming, who bought it for his wife.</dd>
